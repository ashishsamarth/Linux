Scenario: You have a VM (Oracle Linux 7) created using oracle virtual box (.ova format), but its not able to connect to ethernet, after you move it to QNAP-Virtualization station.

Solution:
1. Open the QNAP VM (The VM created using the .ova file)
2. Login as root
3. Navigate to /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts
4. copy the ifcfg-enp0s3 (old ethernet configuration file from the device, where the VM was initially created) to ifcfg-ens3(Here, ens3 is the ethernet interface name from one of the network adaptor on QNAP NAS)
5. change the values for following variables to "ens3"
    NAME=
    DEVICE=
6. reboot the machine
7. Login as root
8. Execute ifconfig and get the inet address from ens3 interface, this is the IP address of the machine
9. Now, you should be able to login to this machine, directly from any ssh client.

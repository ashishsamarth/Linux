1.  Login to the machine (Assumption - This user has permissions to execute sudo)

2.  To check which kernel is already configured as the current default kernel to use at boot, execute the following
    sudo grubby --default-kernel

    Output:
    /boot/vmlinuz-5.4.17-2136.300.7.el8uek.x86_64

3.  To check, all available kernels at boot, execute the following
    sudo ls -l /boot/vmlinuz*

    Output:
    (base) [devops@develop Linux]$ sudo ls -l /boot/vmlinuz*
    -rwxr-xr-x. 1 root root 10348096 Jan 10 18:33 /boot/vmlinuz-0-rescue-33e301ed68324e5e9dab7b26a709945e

Once Oracle Linux server is installed, the default installation will not have internet connectivity.

a. How to enable internet connectivity
	1. Connect the machine to an active LAN connection.
	2. Reboot the machine and Login again.
	3. Switch to root user.
	4. On the terminal, type : nmtui
	5. Since the LAN port is connected, Under the Activate Connection, "Wired" will be shown.
	6. Navigate to Wired and Activate the connection and repeat steps 2 and 3.
	7. Get the IP Address of the machine with : nslookup `hostname` and keep a note of it.
	8. On the terminal type: yum install NetworkManager-Wifi -y
	9. This package will enable Wifi adaptor and machine will be able to connect to wifi once installed.
	10. Repeat step 4.
	11. On the Text User Interface, select 'Edit the Connection' for Wifi and provide the password.
	12. Repeat step 5 for the preferred Wifi connection this time.
	13. Disconnect the machine from the active LAN connection
	14. Repeat step 2
	15. Machine will be connected to the preferred Wifi SSID.
	16. Get the IP Address of the machine with : hostname -I and keep a note of it

b. Modify /etc/hosts with domain information
	1. Login to the machine and switch to root user.
	2. Open /etc/hosts with vi editor.
	3. There will be few existing entries in the file.
	4. Append the file with the IP address of the LAN connection, the hostname with FQDN and hostname.
	5. Again Append the file with the IP address of the Wifi connection, the hostname with FQDN and hostname.

c. Add Variables in .bashrc as oracle user
	# Oracle Settings
	export PATH=$PATH:/usr/sbin:/usr/local/bin
	export PATH=$PATH:$ORACLE_HOME/bin

	export TMP=/tmp
	export TMPDIR=$TMP

	export ORACLE_HOSTNAME=OL7.lan
	export ORACLE_UNQNAME=orcloltp
	export ORACLE_BASE=/u01/app/oracle
	export ORACLE_HOME=$ORACLE_BASE/product/21.0.0/dbhome_1
	export ORA_INVENTORY=/u01/app/oraInventory
	export ORACLE_SID=orcloltp
	export PDB_NAME=orclpdb
	export DATA_DIR=/u02/oradata
	export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$ORACLE_HOME/lib:/lib:/usr/lib
	export CLASSPATH=$ORACLE_HOME/jlib:$ORACLE_HOME/rdbms/jlib
	export TNS_ADMIN=$ORACLE_HOME/network/admin

d. Make updates to tnsnames.ora and listener.ora under $TNS_ADMIN as oracle user
	for tnsnames.ora
	1. for LISTENER_SERVICENAME :- modify the hostname with host ip address
	2. for SERVICENAME : Add an additional address with host ip address
	
	After changes the file will look like the following
	
	[oracle@OL7 admin]$ more tnsnames.ora
	# tnsnames.ora Network Configuration File: /u01/app/oracle/homes/OraDB21Home1/network/admin/tnsnames.ora
	# Generated by Oracle configuration tools.

	LISTENER_ORCLOLTP =
  	 (ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL = TCP)(HOST = 192.168.1.106)(PORT = 1521))

	ORCLOLTP =
  	(DESCRIPTION =
    	 (ADDRESS_LIST=
		(ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL = TCP)(HOST = OL7.lan)(PORT = 1521))
		(ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL = TCP)(HOST = 192.168.1.106)(PORT = 1521)))
    	 (CONNECT_DATA =
      		(SERVER = DEDICATED)
      		(SERVICE_NAME = orcloltp))
  	)
	[oracle@OL7 admin]$ 

	for listener.ora
	1. for LISTENER :- modify the hostname with host ip address
	
	After changes the file will look like the following
	
	[oracle@OL7 admin]$ more listener.ora
	# listener.ora Network Configuration File: /u01/app/oracle/homes/OraDB21Home1/network/admin/listener.ora
	# Generated by Oracle configuration tools.

	LISTENER =
  	 (DESCRIPTION_LIST =
    	  (DESCRIPTION =
      		(ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL = TCP)(HOST = 192.168.1.106)(PORT = 1521))
      		(ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL = IPC)(KEY = EXTPROC1521)))
  	)
	[oracle@OL7 admin]$ 

e. Start the listener as oracle user using: lsnrctl start LISTENER
f. Once the listener is up and running start the database using: dbstart $ORACLE_HOME
g. Open the port 1521 on this host for incoming application connections
	1. Login to the host and switch to root user
	2. Open the port using: firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=1521/tcp
	3. Reload the firewall: firewall-cmd --reload
	4. Validate the update: firewall-cmd --list-ports
h. Database can now accept connection from incoming applications with correct credentials

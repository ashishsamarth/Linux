1.  Create a directory to hold the inventory file, so that its easy to run the ansible command from the current directory
    A basic inventory file will have the hostnames, following is a sample inventory file, with two hostnames, it can IPV4s as well

    samarth@optiplex:~/hands-on-ansible/exercise-0001$ cat e001-inventory
    vboxol79
    odb21c
    samarth@optiplex:~/hands-on-ansible/exercise-0001$ 

2.  If you want to run the ansible command on a specific host in the inventory file, it will look like the following

    samarth@optiplex:~/hands-on-ansible/exercise-0001$ ansible odb21c -i e001-inventory -u oracle -m ping -k
    SSH password: 
    [WARNING]: Platform linux on host odb21c is using the discovered Python interpreter at /usr/bin/python, but future installation of another Python interpreter could change the meaning of that path.
    See https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/2.10/reference_appendices/interpreter_discovery.html for more information.
    odb21c | SUCCESS => {
        "ansible_facts": {
            "discovered_interpreter_python": "/usr/bin/python"
        },
        "changed": false,
        "ping": "pong"
    }
    samarth@optiplex:~/hands-on-ansible/exercise-0001$ 

    Special Notes:
    a.  ansible         :   Keyword that you must use
    b.  odb21c          :   Hostname of the host you want to manage remotely using ansible control server
    c.  -i              :   Is the switch in ansible to indicate the use of inventory file
    d.  e001-inventory  :   Name of the inventory file to be used, running in the current directory
    e.  -u              :   Is the switch to provide the username
    f.  oracle          :   Is the username for the remote machine
    g.  -m              :   Is the switch to indicate the command you want to run
    h.  ping            :   Command that will run on the remote host
    i.  -k              :   Switch for ansible to ask for host password

    Ansible provides a JSON output in the result:
        odb21c | SUCCESS => {
        "ansible_facts": {
            "discovered_interpreter_python": "/usr/bin/python"
        },
        "changed": false,
        "ping": "pong"
        }

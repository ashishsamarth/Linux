1.  Create a directory to hold the inventory file, so that its easy to run the ansible command from the current directory
    A basic inventory file will have the hostnames, following is a sample inventory file, with two hostnames, it can IPV4s as well

    samarth@optiplex:~/hands-on-ansible/exercise-0001$ cat e001-inventory
    vboxol79
    odb21c
    samarth@optiplex:~/hands-on-ansible/exercise-0001$ 

2.  If you want to run the ansible command on a specific host in the inventory file, it will look like the following

    samarth@optiplex:~/hands-on-ansible/exercise-0001$ ansible odb21c -i e001-inventory -u oracle -m ping -k
    SSH password: 
    [WARNING]: Platform linux on host odb21c is using the discovered Python interpreter at /usr/bin/python, but future installation of another Python interpreter could change the meaning of that path.
    See https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/2.10/reference_appendices/interpreter_discovery.html for more information.
    odb21c | SUCCESS => {
        "ansible_facts": {

        },

        "ping": "pong"

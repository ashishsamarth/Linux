1.  Login to the machine, create a dedicated folder and navigate to it, or use the $HOME directory

2.  Execute the following to create (initialize) a Vagrant file
        vagrant init

3.  Above mentioned commnand, will create a 'Vagrantfile' in the current directory
    This file holds a sample of how to configure the vagrant file to spin up a vm, and is written in ruby

4.  Open the 'VagrantFile' in vi or an editor of your choice, the default file will look like the following

	# -*- mode: ruby -*-
	# vi: set ft=ruby :
	
	# All Vagrant configuration is done below. The "2" in Vagrant.configure
	# configures the configuration version (we support older styles for
	# backwards compatibility). Please don't change it unless you know what
	# you're doing.
	Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
		config.(base)
        	# A lot of information in the comments
        	# A lot of information in the comments
        	# A lot of information in the comments
        	# A lot of information in the comments
	end

5.  To spin an Ubuntu vm, we need to modify the VagrantFile to look like the following.
    Note: The configurations are nested similar to python code (tabbed)
	# -*- mode: ruby -*-
	# vi: set ft=ruby :
	
	# All Vagrant configuration is done below. The "2" in Vagrant.configure
	# configures the configuration version (we support older styles for
	# backwards compatibility). Please don't change it unless you know what
	# you're doing.
	Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
        	# The following line indicates the 'name' of the vm to be created
		config.vm.define "acs" do |acs|
            		# The following line defines the 'operating system' on the vm
			acs.vm.box="ubuntu/trusty64"
            		# The following line defines the 'hostname' of the vm
			acs.vm.hostname="acs"
            		# The following line defines the 'network type' and 'ip address' of the vm
			acs.vm.network "private_network", ip:"192.168.33.10"
		end
	end

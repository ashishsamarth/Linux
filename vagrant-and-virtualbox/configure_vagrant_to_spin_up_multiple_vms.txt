1.  Login to the machine, create a dedicated folder and navigate to it, or use the $HOME directory

2.  Execute the following to create (initialize) a Vagrant file
        vagrant init

3.  Above mentioned commnand, will create a 'Vagrantfile' in the current directory
    This file holds a sample of how to configure the vagrant file to spin up a vm, and is written in ruby

4.  Open the 'VagrantFile' in vi or an editor of your choice, the default file will look like the following

	# -*- mode: ruby -*-
	# vi: set ft=ruby :
	
	# All Vagrant configuration is done below. The "2" in Vagrant.configure
	# configures the configuration version (we support older styles for
	# backwards compatibility). Please don't change it unless you know what
	# you're doing.
	Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
		config.(base)
        	# A lot of information in the comments
        	# A lot of information in the comments
        	# A lot of information in the comments
        	# A lot of information in the comments
	end

5.  To spin up multiple vms, we need to modify the VagrantFile to look like the following.
    Note: The configurations are nested similar to python code (tabbed)

    # -*- mode: ruby -*-
    # vi: set ft=ruby :

    # All Vagrant configuration is done below. The "2" in Vagrant.configure
    # configures the configuration version (we support older styles for
    # backwards compatibility). Please don't change it unless you know what
    # you're doing.
    Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
            # configuration for a ubuntu vm
            config.vm.define "ubuntu" do |ubuntu|
                    ubuntu.vm.box="ubuntu/trusty64"
                    ubuntu.vm.hostname="ubuntu"
                    ubuntu.vm.network "private_network", ip:"192.168.56.2"
            end
            # configuration for a fedora vm
            config.vm.define "fedora" do |fedora|
                    fedora.vm.box="generic/fedora28"
                    fedora.vm.hostname="fedora"
                    fedora.vm.network "private_network", ip:"192.168.56.3"
            end
            # configuration for a centos vm
            config.vm.define "centos" do |centos|
                    centos.vm.box="centos/7"
                    centos.vm.hostname="centos"
                    centos.vm.network "private_network", ip:"192.168.56.4"
            end
    end

6.  Now, that the vagrant file has been configured to spin up 3 vms, save and exit the file, and execute the following on terminal
    vagrant up

    Output:
